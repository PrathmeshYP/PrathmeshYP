# 🛠️ Projects :

📄 Infralink (SIH 2024 Project) :

Developed a platform to predict and resolve conflicts in government construction projects using machine learning for proactive risk mitigation Handled the core backend unit using Node.js + Express to connect the ML prediction Service, data scraping Service, and frontend interface. Designed REST APIs, managed inter-service communication, and implemented the main conflict detection logic based on coordinate conflicts and data from various sources

📄 KisanSmart-Irrigation :

This project is a Smart Irrigation System designed to optimize water usage for agriculture or gardening. The system monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, and automatically controls a water pump to irrigate plants only when necessary. This ensures efficient water usage and promotes healthy plant growth.

📄 Dairy Management System :

This project is a Python-based Dairy Management System developed as a Mini Project. It is designed to manage basic dairy operations such as milk receipt entry, report generation, and database connectivity in a simple and efficient way. The project is suitable for academic and learning purposes and follows a modular programming approach.

📄 Designing of EV Battery Monitoring System :

Designed a low-cost EV Battery Monitoring System using Arduino to track voltage, current, temperature, SOC, and SOH in real time.
Implemented sensor-based fault detection to enhance battery safety and reliability.
Validated system accuracy through experimental testing on different EV battery types.
Developed a scalable and practical alternative to complex commercial BMS solutions.

📄 Dairy Management System :
